A command-line utility to select S3 keys interactively.

This tool best suits cases in which you want to interactively select an s3 key in your shell script.
As we currently do not support to search files at a specific directory level, this tool is only usable if you have a limited number of keys per directory level.
This is e.g. the case if you upload one file per day to your bucket and structure its s3 key as follows: `<year>/<month>/<day>/<upload-timestamp>.zip`.

We wrote this cli tool as there is a lack of comparable tools in the open-source space.
Our research considered the following similar tools:

- pypi: [s3-browser](https://pypi.org/project/s3-browser/)

## Installation

### NPM

`npx s3-browser-cli`

### Nix

`nix profile install github:nesto-software/s3-browser-cli`

Builds are cached on *nesto* cachix with the following pubkey:   
`nesto.cachix.org-1:lIoJWOEaqqvUmcSzncCwRntE9HP7NopO1Q5HdtN7Jr8=`

Package is also distributed on [NUR](https://nur.nix-community.org/repos/mloeper/).

## Synopsis

`s3select [options]`

Note: You must be logged-in to an AWS account on the CLI. That is, the AWS-SDK built into this tool must be able to locate credentials either via config file or env vars.

### Options

- `--bucket <bucket-name>`: A bucket to pre-select. When specifying the bucket parameter with the name of a valid S3 account owned by your AWS account, the inquirer-s3 module will start to browse at the root of this bucket.
- `--objectPrefix <key>`: An S3 object prefix indicating where you'd like to start the browsing inside a bucket.
- `--enableFolderSelect`: If set, the user is allowed to select an S3 *folder* prefix as a valid result, default false.
- `--enableFileObjectSelect`: If set, the user is allowed to select an S3 object (*files*) as a valid result, default true.
- `--enableOtherBuckets`: If set, the user should be allowed to navigate to buckets other than the bucket parameter specified, default true.

Note: It is invalid to pass an *objectPrefix* without specifying a valid bucket.   
Note: The *objectPrefix* must be a *folder*, i.e. a key's prefix not the full object's key.

## Output Format

```json
{ 
    "bucket": "acme-bucket",
    "prefix":"09036d7c13ed8e39d23d5552b0f46fb5125764f2df8c85fd313873931631ceff.zip",
    "objectUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/acme-bucket/09036d7c13ed8e39d23d5552b0f46fb5125764f2df8c85fd313873931631ceff.zip",
    "s3Uri":"s3://acme-bucket/09036d7c13ed8e39d23d5552b0f46fb5125764f2df8c85fd313873931631ceff.zip"
}
```

## Shell Script Usage Example

```bash
TMP_FILE=$(mktemp)
s3select --redirect 3>$TMP_FILE

SELECTED_S3_KEY=$(cat $TMP_FILE | jq -r '.prefix')
```

Note: When using the `--redirect` option, you have to pass the file descriptor 3 to the s3select binary. This might not work if you call the binary via a wrapper like `npm run` or `pnpm exec`. Call the utility in *node_modules/.bin` instead.

**Why is getting the output so difficult?**

This tool uses *inquirer-s3* under the hood which depends on an old version of *inquirer*.
In new versions of inquirer, there is a [fix](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365/issues/5489) to this problem and inquirer uses stderr insted of stdout.
We work around this limitation by using our custom file description with number 3.
